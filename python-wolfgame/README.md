# Werewolves Game Simulation

## 🧩 Description

This project is a simulation of a strategic game involving werewolves, food, and different teams. Players (human, AI, or remote) can move, fight, pacify, or feed their werewolves on a grid-based map. The game uses colored terminal output for visual representation.

## ⚙️ Prerequisites

Before running the code, make sure you have the following:

1. **Python Environment**  
   Ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your system.

2. **Install Dependencies**  
   Install the required library using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install blessed
   ```

3. **Use a Compatible Terminal**  
   The game uses the `blessed` library for colored terminal output.  
   **Do not use JetBrains' integrated terminal** — it does not support colored output properly.

   ✅ Recommended terminals:
   - Windows Terminal
   - macOS Terminal / iTerm2
   - Linux GNOME Terminal / Konsole / etc.
   - VS Code integrated terminal (works well)

## 🚀 How to Run

Once the prerequisites are met:

```bash
python main.py
```

Make sure the required `.ano` map file is in the same directory or specify the correct path in the code.

Enjoy the game!
